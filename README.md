# togglehead.nvim
inspired by lasamat

``<leader>ct`` to toggle between ``.h / .cpp`` file in current buffer<br>
``<leader>cv`` to open opposite filetype in vertical split<br>
``<leader>cV`` to open opposite filetype in horizontal split<br>

- the splits works so that if you are in .cpp file, it will open .h in the selected split
